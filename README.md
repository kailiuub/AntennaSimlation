2. NEC2++ Intro: NEC2++ is a free (GPL v2) electromagnetic simulation software compatable with NEC-2. It has been rewritten from the ground up.Nec2++ consists of a library that can be called from C++, C, python and Ruby, and so it can incorporated into other projects like GUI tools and automatic antenna optimization systems. There is also an executable necpp that can read antenna description files (like the original). Nec2++ is developed on Debian linux, but will work on a variety of other operating systems.
